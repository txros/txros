"""
:mod:`txros` provides independent extensions to ROS that can be used across other
packages. These extensions primarily focus on asynchronous extensions for most
ROS classes, including nodes, subscribers, and publishers. Furthermore, proxies to
ROS over TCP are provided for communication inside the package.

Generally, this package is used for the :class:`~txros.NodeHandle` class and its
neighbors in client code. Classes in this module are generally not inherited from
for extensions.
